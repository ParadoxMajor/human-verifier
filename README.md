# Human Verifier

🤖 Beep boop. Do you have trouble telling when a user is human? Do you not allow bots to post and comment on your subreddit? Install this app to help!

Just select the 'Verify Human' mod action from a post or comment, and flag them for verification. It notifies them via modmail that they've been requested to confirm they are human and explains how to complete it. Until they confirm, their posts and comments are automatically removed (by default, can be adjusted for reporting or doing nothing in settings). If they take too long to confirm, they can be considered automatically failed, as well as other options in the app settings.

Modmail verification requests are auto-archived for your peace of mind (unless they reply, of course).

# Future Enhancements

* Allows sub to optionally define rules for sending automated human verification requests
* Post/Comment Guidance integration where possible. To start, you may have to define your own mod-only flair to use as a block flag and set up the Post/Comment Guidance rules for that user flair
* Add more settings, such as considering approved users as already verified and always keeping the status mod note first, for easier reference
* Display a user breakdown for mods when checking human status
* Add a user-lookup form, so mods can override verification status if user deleted all their posts or comments
* Better human checks
